Nor should they. Because the goal of the project probably isn't to find *every single* interesting item in the universe but to find *some* interesting stuff that may lead on to further interesting stuff, through investing a reasonable amount of effort. Which is perfectly fine.\nSorry, I must be sounding awfully argumentative, and I apologise for that, but I just don't think there's any point in me continuing to flag up something on which the general consensus is that it's uninteresting rubbish, because even if there *were* something interesting hiding among the rubbish, the odds of it being missed would be pretty high, no?\n\nHanny's Whatsit is a different situation, because as far as I understood it that was basically a one-off (and it's probably telling that it's still the go-to counterexample after so many years). But if she had used the same tag for it that she had been using for a fun but useless collection of colourful noise and artifacts and she had been known for being the person who collects colourful rubbish, it may never have caught anyone's eye. And that's the point I'm trying to make here: if I keep on collecting hundreds of red dots that are uninteresting, I'll be burying the one potential red dot that *might* be interesting under a mountain of colourful (well, *red*) rubbish, and at the end of the day, that isn't really in anyone's interest. So it would probably be the better choice for me to stop collecting and then *maybe* the potentially interesting red dot will be spotted by someone knowledgeable who can identify it as different from the run-of-the-mill red dots that I would have lumped them in with.","comment_focus_id":86703281,"comment_focus_type":"Subject","comment_user_id":352990,"comment_user_login":"mutabilitie","comment_created_at":"2023-04-20T05:12:37.267Z"},{"board_id":4510,"board_title":"Notes","board_description":"General comment threads about individual subjects","discussion_id":2893343,"discussion_title":"Subject 86999302","comment_id":4747376,"comment_body":"#disturbed #ring but it is not clear who is disturbing it.

The thing that's \"missing\" is an obvious galaxy from which the BH could have escaped, although there are some options (eg the red galaxy at  182.0050, -1.0904).\n\u003e If I had to guess, I'd say it's probably a tidal feature that is connected to the galaxies to the lower left; there is some hint of a connection. An alternative is a bulgeless edge-on galaxy (see Sanchez Almeida et al 2023 ).\n\n\u003e However, a runaway SMBH is certainly a possibility, and I'd say it's worth checking out!  Deeper imaging would help, to see if it is separate from the little group of bright galaxies to the lower left, and of course a spectrum.  Unfortunately we just had a Keck run and it's not up in the Fall, so we won't have another opportunity until next year probably.\n\n\n\n","comment_focus_id":86992789,"comment_focus_type":"Subject","comment_user_id":172,"comment_user_login":"karthikeyan.d","comment_created_at":"2023-05-04T03:56:45.372Z"},{"board_id":4510,"board_title":"Notes","board_description":"General comment threads about individual subjects","discussion_id":2893345,"discussion_title":"Subject 86992789","comment_id":4779918,"comment_body":"Excellent observation!","comment_focus_id":86992789,"comment_focus_type":"Subject","comment_user_id":247,"comment_user_login":"Budgieye","comment_created_at":"2023-05-04T06:51:36.667Z"},{"board_id":4512,"board_title":"Announcements","board_description":"Important announcements and status updates","discussion_id":2911145,"discussion_title":"Project Complete! -- Thank you!","comment_id":4779924,"comment_body":"This has been a great project, with lots of exciting galaxies!\nThank you!\n\nA reminder that Galaxy Zoo is still running.\nhttps://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zookeeper/galaxy-zoo\n\nThere are more astronomy projects listed in\nhttps://www.zooniverse.org/projects?discipline=astronomy\u0026page=1\u0026status=live","comment_focus_id":null,"comment_focus_type":null,"comment_user_id":247,"comment_user_login":"Budgieye","comment_created_at":"2023-05-04T06:58:33.190Z"},{"board_id":4513,"board_title":"General Galaxies Chat","board_description":"Discussion about galaxies and astronomy in general.

They exhibit a bright, luminous disk at their center, with striking spiral arms radiating outward from a central bulge. The arms comprise pockets of gas and dust, which foster the formation of new stars, as well as clusters of young and bright stars.
